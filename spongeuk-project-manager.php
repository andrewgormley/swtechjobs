          <h2>Project Manager</h2>
          <h3><a href="https://spongeuk.com/" target="_blank">Sponge UK</a> - Plymouth, with UK and global travel</h3>
          <p>Contract type: Full time</p>
          <p>Salary: Competitive</p>

        <div class="jobAdvert__body">

          <p>
            You’re compulsively organised and always thinking three steps ahead of your projects. Your natural
            instinct to dig deep enables you to shape and control your projects just the way you like.
          </p>

          <p>
            You’ll do whatever it takes to guide clients and internal teams through multiple project deliveries with
            a typical life cycle of two to six months and budgets ranging from £15k - 200k.
          </p>

          <p>
            As well as being exceptional at planning, you love coordinating teams and juggling competing
            priorities...everyone’s priority is the most urgent, right? It’s your strength of character and passion
            which provide the substance to keep teams together and on track.
          </p>

          <p>
            No two projects are ever the same but that doesn’t faze you. You are used to managing and
            foreseeing the constant changes that occur and are comfortable and confident delivering hard news
            to all stakeholders.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your unique business awareness gives you the ability to facilitate from a higher strategic level,
            delivering excellence at every opportunity and ensuring you lead with both the project and
            company’s best interest in mind.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s skills like these that enable us to deliver excellence to our clients through our digital learning
            services and products.
          </p>
