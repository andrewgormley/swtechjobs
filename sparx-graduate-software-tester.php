          <p>
            Here at Sparx we're using a scientific and research-based approach that takes the guesswork out of education.

            Our platform for maths uses custom-built content and a powerful, data-driven web and mobile framework to deliver a tailored set of exercises, games and incentives that are redefining the limits of what young people can achieve.
            We’re looking for people with a real passion for education and a belief in the power of technology to improve it; people who want a challenge and people who want to make a difference.

            If you’ve got a strong academic background in a technical subject, experience with programming languages, outstanding communication skills and a passion for technology, you’ll relish this opportunity.

          <h3>About you</h3>
          <p>
            You may be graduating in 2017 or have recently graduated, but you’re insatiably curious and love learning. You’re passionate about technology so you’ll be confident using our unique system and using your strong communication skills to explain to others how it works. A creative thinker, you’ll possess the ability to conceive of all possible test cases and then utilise your technical expertise to formulate them. You’ll enjoy the challenge of tracking down and reproducing tricky bugs, using whatever technology is most appropriate to the task at hand. No two days are the same, so you’ll be able to work under pressure and be comfortable in a fast-paced technical environment with constantly changing priorities and a fluctuating workload.  Multi-tasking, organisation and problem solving are your strengths and you have a strong teamwork ethic.
            You’ll also be able to get going of your own accord, a true self-starter using your initiative to get stuff done. You have the ability to focus on your work without losing sight of what’s going on around you and the wider company objectives.
            We like a good list, so here’s an overview of some of the specific skills and experience we’re looking for:
